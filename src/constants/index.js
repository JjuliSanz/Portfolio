The backend API handles user authentication, booking creation and management, and communication with the database. On the frontend, we use React, a powerful JavaScript library, to build a dynamic and interactive user interface. Users can browse accommodations, search for available dates, view details, and make bookings. React components handle rendering, state management, and user interactions. We utilize React Router to enable routing and navigation within the application. ",
