# 3D Portfolio

Welcome to my "ThreeJS 3D Developer Portfolio" project! This repository showcases hoy I've builded this impressive 3D website using the powerful combination of ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.

With ThreeJS, I've created stunning 3D graphics and animations that bring my portfolio to life. React Three Fiber seamlessly integrates ThreeJS into my React components, allowing for dynamic and interactive 3D experiences.

The project utilizes TailwindCSS for easy and stylish styling, while Framer Motion adds captivating animations to enhance user engagement. The portfolio includes a contact form for easy communication and is fully responsive across all devices.

By following industry best practices and utilizing reusable and scalable code, I've created a portfolio that showcases my skills and understanding of 3D web development.
